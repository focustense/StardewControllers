Many players will find that they rely pretty heavily on a small set of core tools, consumables and mod shortcuts, and need to access them very quickly and precisely. The image below shows a setup optimized for a Skull Cavern run, or more generally \"mining + combat\":</p> <p></p> <p>Fairly typical min-max mining strategy involves the pickaxe, a melee weapon, lots of bombs and staircases, an assortment of healing and buff items, and sometimes a utility mod or two such as Swap Rings. These can all fit in the 8 quick slots: one for each d-pad direction, and one for each primary button.</p> <p>A more farming-centric setup might include the hoe, watering can, fertilizer and scythe on one side, along with mod actions to show overlays for unwatered/unfertilized crops, scarecrow and sprinkler ranges, etc. on the other side.</p> <p>Quick actions/quick slots have the following properties:</p> <ul> <li>They are performed while the controller overlay is shown, i.e. while a pie menu is visible, by pressing the associated button (  or  / / / ) without pointing the analog stick.</li> <li>They stay bound, in the same position, even if the action is no longer possible, e.g. if you run out of the item in your inventory. In this instance, as shown above, they will display grayed out, and flash red if you try to activate one.</li> <li>The type of activation is determined by how you set up the slot\u2014i.e. you choose in the configuration whether to perform the primary or secondary action, and also whether to display a confirmation dialog first.</li> <li>If you do not have the original item, but have a similar item, it will use that instead. For example, if the Copper Pickaxe is in one slot and you upgrade it to the Steel Pickaxe, then the slot will use the Steel Pickaxe. Similarly, the image above shows the Galaxy Sword in the right d-pad slot, but if that specific weapon is not available, it will search for other melee weapons in your inventory and choose the one with the best stats.</li> </ul> <p>These attributes are ideal for actions that will be performed frequently but not constantly. For the latter, there are instant actions instead. Quick actions are significantly more customizable but take longer to set up and an extra button press to activate; they are meant to be set up once and used throughout an entire run or play session.</p> <p>A secondary use of quick actions is to restore semi-common vanilla functionality for buttons remapped by instant actions. For example, if you've decided to remap the   button to some specific tool, then you might add a quick slot for opening the vanilla main menu, or the map, both of which are provided as Library Actions in Star Control.</p>"},{"location":"instant-actions/","title":"Instant Actions","text":"<p>Star Control's Instant Actions are also called Remapping, as the feature allows you to choose almost any button on the gamepad and assign it to any action you like.</p> <p>In comparison to external tools like Steam Input or rewasd, Star Control's instant actions:</p> <ul> <li>Don't require any separate apps, or a particular edition of the game;</li> <li>Can be reassigned while in-game, using an in-game UI;</li> <li>Are assigned to specific Items or Actions, similar to quick actions, which is more flexible than mapping to a specific key or a different button;</li> <li>Will actually use the item in that slot when pressed, as in performing axe chops, sword slashes, and so on, which is normally only possible with  .</li> </ul> <p>You've probably seen these in many other games:</p> Game Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Ori and the Will of the Wisps Dead Cells <p>It's not much of a stretch to say that almost every modern game and many not-so-modern games have these \"slot-based\" control schemes.
