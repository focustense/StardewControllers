(aka: "Better Gamepads")

![Full overlay screenshot](docs/images/screenshot-controller-overlay.png)

## Background

Star Control (**Star**dew **Control**lers) is a mod and framework for replacing Stardew Valley's dated Harvest Moon-style gamepad control scheme with the modal, remappable controls found in modern games, and making the majority of other Stardew mods convenient to interact with using a controller.

Main features include:
- [Pie menus](https://focustense.github.io/StardewControllers/controller-hud/#pie-menus): dynamic radial/wheel style menus for inventory and mod actions that can be navigated with the analog stick;
- [Quick Actions](https://focustense.github.io/StardewControllers/controller-hud/#quick-actions): reassignable one-button actions that are active while the pie menu overlay is open;
- [Instant Actions](https://focustense.github.io/StardewControllers/instant-actions/): reassignable "Zelda-style" one-button actions that be bound to tool swings, melee combat, bomb placement and other in-world actions;
- A complete in-game [configuration system](https://focustense.github.io/StardewControllers/configuration/) for managing all the menus, shortcuts and bindings;
- [Mod API](https://focustense.github.io/StardewControllers/api/) for other mods to register their own actions and custom pages.

## Documentation

User and integrator documentation, including all content on this page, is available at the [Star Control Docs](https://focustense.github.io/StardewControllers/).

Using Star Control requires:
